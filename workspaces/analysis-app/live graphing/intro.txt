live plotting using pyqtgraph

first run app experiment.py and then run live plotting.py to plot a live updating sin curve. 
if you do not run app experiment first then running live plotting will produce "no file found"
if you close the app experiment.py program then live plotting will continuously plot x = 0, y = 0
